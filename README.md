# Stack
This is the repository of the stack programming language
As the name suggests, this language has a runtime that supports many of the widely used stack operations such as load,pop etc.
(only load has been implemented as of yet)
A very simple sample of the language can be found in the file sample.st where you will see :
```
load 48
print 
```
This code will load the integer 48 into the stack and then print its contents before exiting
