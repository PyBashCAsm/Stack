# Stack
This is the repository of the stack programming language.\
As the name suggests, this language has a runtime that supports many of the widely used stack operations such as load,pop etc.
(only load has been implemented as of yet)
A very simple sample of the language can be found in the file sample.st where you will see :
```
load 48
load 96
add
print 
```
This code will **load** the integer 48 and 96 into the stack ,then using the **add** instruction it will add the 2 items on the stack and
print the sum on the screen
